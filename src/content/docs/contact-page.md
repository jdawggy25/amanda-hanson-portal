# Contact Page SEO Implementation

**URL:** /contact

---

## Current Problems

| Element | Current Text | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| H1 | "Contact Us!" | Generic |
| H2 | "We Love to Hear from You" | Tagline, no keywords |
| H2 | "Send us a message" | Form label |
| H2 | "Locations" | Duplicate of locations page |
| H2 | "Contact information" | Generic |

**Note:** Contact pages don't drive major organic traffic, but they should still support the site's topical relevance and include proper NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency.

## NAP Consistency (CRITICAL)

The contact page shows:
- **Phone:** +1 (503) 916-9758
- **Address:** 17815 NW Tillamook Dr, Portland, Oregon 97229
- **Email:** info@casitaazulpdx.org

### Action Required
Ensure this **EXACT format** appears identically on:
- [ ] Every page footer
- [ ] Google Business Profile
- [ ] All directory listings
- [ ] Schema markup

**Why it matters:** Inconsistent NAP (even small differences like "Dr" vs "Drive") hurts local SEO rankings.
