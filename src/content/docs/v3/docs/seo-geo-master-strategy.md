# V3 Biomedical: Comprehensive SEO & GEO Strategy
## 3-Month Strategic Roadmap (December 2025 - February 2026)

---

## Executive Summary

This strategic analysis synthesizes all existing SEO assets, identifies critical gaps, and presents an expanded 3-month roadmap that incorporates both traditional SEO and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** principles for AI-driven search visibility.

### Key Findings

1. **Keyword Opportunity**: "Wound expert" (6,900 volume, difficulty 12) represents a significant low-competition opportunity
2. **GEO Gap**: No current strategy for AI Overview optimization (appearing on 80%+ of target SERPs)
3. **Content Gap**: Patient-facing content is underrepresented despite competitor success (WoundZoom model)
4. **Video Gap**: 75% of target SERPs feature video previews with no video strategy in place
5. **Authority Gap**: Minimal thought leadership or expert citation strategy

3. **Statistical citations**: Clinical outcomes, efficiency metrics
4. **Institutional references**: Medical associations, research institutions
5. **Schema markup**: Organization, Product, FAQ, HowTo, MedicalCondition
