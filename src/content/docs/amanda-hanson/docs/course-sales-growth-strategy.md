## Market Opportunity Analysis

### Total Addressable Market

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Global e-learning market | $315 billion (2024) |
| Personal development segment | $44 billion |
| Women's share of self-improvement | 65-70% |

### Market Growth Drivers

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Audience | Price Range | Gap for Amanda |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Marie Forleo | 700K+ IG | $2,497 (B-School) | More intimate, transformation-focused |
| Gabby Bernstein | 1.1M IG | $297-$2,000 | Less spiritual, more practical |
| Mel Robbins | 6M+ IG | $47-$497 | More premium, depth over breadth |

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Product Suite

| Tier | Product | Price | Status |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| Entry | The Invisible Weight | $29-$50 | Active |
| Mid | Queen's Inauguration (self-study) | $999 | Active |
| Mid | Single 1:1 Session | $999 | Active |
| High | VIP Day (Miami) | $5,555 | Active |
| High | Queen's Reign Mastermind | $8,888 | Active |
| Premium | 12-Month VIP Coaching | By application | Active |
| Membership | The Muses | Hidden pricing | Active |

### Identified Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|
| No free lead magnet/quiz | Losing 90%+ of potential email captures | CRITICAL |
| No $2,000-$5,000 live group program | Missing bridge to high-ticket | HIGH |
| Membership pricing hidden | Losing impulse buyers | HIGH |
| No ManyChat/DM automation | 10x conversion opportunity missed | HIGH |
| No certification program | Revenue ceiling, no leverage | MEDIUM |
| No corporate/B2B offerings | Untapped high-margin channel | MEDIUM |

### Conversion Funnel Analysis

**Current State:**
```
Instagram (947K) → Bio Link (2-3% click) → Website → ? → Purchase
                   ↓
              ~28K annual visitors, unknown email conversion
```

**Problem:** No systematic capture of the 947K followers into owned audience (email list).
