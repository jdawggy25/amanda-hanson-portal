**Q: Do I need to speak Spanish at home for my child to attend?**
A: No! Most of our families are English-speaking at home. Children learn Spanish through full immersion at school, and our teachers support the transition for new students.

**Q: What ages do you accept for Spanish immersion?**
A: We accept infants as young as 1 month (at select locations) through age 6. Programs are divided into infant (0-12 months), toddler (1-3 years), and preschool (3-5 years).

**Q: Is there a waitlist for Casita Azul?**
A: Some of our locations do have waitlists, especially for infant programs. We recommend contacting us early to check availability at your preferred location.

**Q: What if my child has never been exposed to Spanish?**
A: That's completely normal! Our immersion approach is designed for children with no prior Spanish exposure. Within months, children begin understanding and speaking Spanish naturally.

**Q: Do you offer part-time Spanish immersion?**
A: Schedule options vary by location. Contact us to learn about full-time and part-time availability at your preferred campus.
