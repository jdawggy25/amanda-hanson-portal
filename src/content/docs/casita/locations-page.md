# Locations Page SEO Implementation

**URL:** /locations

---

## Current Problems

| Element | Current Text | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| H1 | "Welcome to Our Casitas!" | Cute but zero SEO value |
| H2 | "Casita 4 - Bethany" | Missing "Spanish daycare/preschool" |
| H2 | "Casita 5 - Infant Program in Bethany" | Better, but no "Spanish" |
| H2 | "Casita 6 - Beaverton Partnership Site" | No keywords |
| H2 | "Tanasbourne Campus" | Missing city + service keywords |
| H2 | "Hillsboro Campus" | Same issue |
| H2 | "Need Help?" | Wasted H2 |

**Big Problem:** Locations in Hillsboro, Beaverton, Bethany, Tanasbourne, Rock Creek, Forest Heights — all different neighborhoods people search for. But "Spanish immersion," "preschool," and "daycare" don't appear in ANY location heading.

| `/locations/beaverton-spanish-daycare/` | spanish daycare beaverton, bilingual preschool beaverton |
| `/locations/bethany-spanish-daycare/` | spanish daycare bethany, daycare near bethany elementary |
| `/locations/tanasbourne-spanish-preschool/` | preschool tanasbourne, daycare tanasbourne hillsboro |
| `/locations/forest-heights-spanish-daycare/` | daycare forest heights, cedar mill spanish preschool |
| `/locations/rock-creek-spanish-preschool/` | spanish preschool rock creek, daycare nw portland |

### Each Location Page Should Include:
- 500-800 words of unique content
- Specific address, hours, phone
- Age ranges served
- Unique features of that location
- Embedded Google Map
- Photos of that specific location
- Testimonials from families at that location
- Schema markup (LocalBusiness) with geo coordinates
- "Nearby landmarks" section (near Nike, near Jackson Elementary, etc.)
