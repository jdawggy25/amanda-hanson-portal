| 1 | 0 | Welcome! Here's your [Lead Magnet] | Deliver promise, set expectations |
| 2 | 1 | My story: From PhD to Midlife Muse | Personal story, relatability |
| 3 | 3 | The #1 mistake midlife women make | Value, problem agitation |
| 4 | 5 | What my most successful clients do differently | Case study, possibility |
| 5 | 7 | Your reinvention roadmap (3 steps) | Framework, teaching |

**Email 1 Template:**

```
Subject: Welcome! Here's your [Lead Magnet Name]

Hi [First Name],

I'm so glad you're here.

In a world that tells women over 40 to "age gracefully" (code for:
disappear quietly), you chose something different.

You chose reinvention.

Here's your [Lead Magnet]: [LINK]

But before you dive in, I want you to know something...

This isn't about fixing what's "wrong" with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.

This is about remembering who you've always been—and finally
giving her permission to come out.

Over the next few weeks, I'll share:
- My own midlife transformation story (it's messier than Instagram shows)
- The exact framework I use with my private clients
- Resources to help you take your first steps

For now, enjoy your [Lead Magnet].

To your reinvention,
Amanda

P.S. Hit reply and tell me: What's ONE thing you'd change about
your life right now if you knew you couldn't fail?
```
