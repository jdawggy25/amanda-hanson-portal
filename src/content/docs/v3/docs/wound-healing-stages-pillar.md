### H1: The 4 Stages of Wound Healing: A Complete Clinical Guide

**TL;DR** (GEO-optimized opening):
Wound healing occurs in four overlapping stages: hemostasis (minutes to hours), inflammation (1-4 days), proliferation (4-21 days), and remodeling (21 days to 2 years). According to research published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, understanding these phases is critical for proper wound assessment and treatment planning. This clinical guide details each phase with timelines, cellular mechanisms, clinical indicators, and documentation requirements for healthcare providers.

- Pain

#### H3: Inflammation vs. Infection
| Sign | Normal Inflammation | Infection |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Duration | 1-4 days | Prolonged |
| Erythema | Localized | Spreading |
| Exudate | Serous | Purulent |
| Odor | None | Present |
