# About Us / Our Story Page SEO Implementation

**URL:** /about-us/our-story (or similar)

---

## Current Problems

| Element | Current Text | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| H1 | "Discover Our Journey!" | Generic, no keywords |
| H2 | "Our Story" | Wasted H2 |
| H2 | "Casita Azul was born from a simple yet powerful vision" | Nice copy, zero SEO |
| H2 | "Building Roots: The Journey Begins" | Storytelling, no keywords |
| H2 | "Abuela's Arrival: Embracing Culture" | Same issue |
| H2 | "The Search: Finding a Warm and Cultural Preschool" | Close but missing keywords |
| H2 | "That's when the idea for Casita Azul and Amanecer Academy was born" | Way too long for H2 |
| H2 | "Welcome to the Casita Azul and Amanecer Academy family" | No keywords |

**Note:** Great founder story with strong E-E-A-T signals (Laura's psychology background, 12 years at Multnomah County Health Dept, Latina-led, family-owned since 2018). This content is GOLD — it just needs keyword optimization in the headings while preserving the narrative.
