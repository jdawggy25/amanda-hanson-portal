# Homepage SEO Implementation

## Current Problems

| Element | Current Text | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| H1 | "Welcome to Casita Azul!" | Zero keyword value |
| H2 | "Bilingual Minds, Boundless Hearts" | Tagline, not searchable |
| H2 | "We do more than teach Spanish" | Vague, no geo |
| H2 | "Discover more about us" | Generic |
| H2 | "We nurture bilingual minds and hearts" | No keywords |
| H2 | "Visit our blog" | Wasted H2 |
| H2 | "We create a foundation for lifelong learning" | No keywords |
| H2 | "Testimonials" | Fine but could be better |

**Core Problem:** 8 headings on the page and NOT ONE contains "Spanish immersion," "preschool," "daycare," or "Portland."

## Meta Tags (Add to `<head>`)

### Title Tag (58 characters)
```
Spanish Immersion Preschool & Daycare Portland | Casita Azul
```

### Meta Description (152 characters)
```
100% Spanish immersion preschool and daycare for ages 0-5 in Portland, OR. 4 loving locations. Nurturing bilingual minds since 2015. Schedule a tour!
```

---

## Heading Structure

### H1 (Main heading - only ONE per page)
```
Spanish Immersion Preschool & Daycare in Portland, Oregon
```

**Note:** Keep tagline "Bilingual Minds, Boundless Hearts" as regular styled text below H1 - it's a nice brand element, just shouldn't be an H2.
