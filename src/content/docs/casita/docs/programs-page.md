# Programs Page SEO Implementation

**URL:** /programs

## Current Problems

| Element | Current Text | Issue |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| H1 | "Discover Our Programs!" | Generic, no keywords |
| H2 | "Infants (0-12 months)" | Missing "Spanish immersion" |
| H3 | "Where Language and Love Begin" | Poetic but not searchable |
| H3 | "Learning Through Love" | No keywords |
| H2 | "Toddlers (1-3 years)" | Missing "Spanish immersion" |
| H3 | "Building Emotional Intelligence and a Love for Learning" | Too long, no keywords |
| H3 | "Spanish Immersion Through Play" | ✓ Finally a keyword! |
| H2 | "Preschool (3-5 years)" | Missing "Spanish immersion" |
| H3 | "Bilingual, Curious, and Ready to Learn" | Tagline, not searchable |

**Problem:** "Spanish immersion" appears exactly ONCE in the headings. This page should rank for "spanish immersion infant program," "spanish toddler classes," "spanish preschool curriculum" etc.

## FUTURE: Split Into Individual Pages

For maximum SEO impact, consider creating separate pages for each age group:

### 1. /programs/infant-spanish-immersion/
- Target: "spanish daycare for infants," "bilingual infant care"
- 800-1200 words of unique content

### 2. /programs/toddler-spanish-classes/
- Target: "spanish classes for toddlers," "toddler spanish immersion"
- 800-1200 words of unique content

### 3. /programs/spanish-immersion-preschool/
- Target: "spanish immersion preschool," "bilingual preschool near me"
- 800-1200 words of unique content

**This creates 3 ranking opportunities instead of 1!**
