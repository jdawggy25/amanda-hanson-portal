## Technical Performance

### Performance Scores (Google Lighthouse)

| Metric | Mobile | Desktop | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Performance | 74/100 | 85/100 | Good, can improve |
| SEO | 100/100 | 100/100 | Excellent |
| Accessibility | 97/100 | 97/100 | Excellent |
| Best Practices | 79/100 | 79/100 | Good |

### Core Web Vitals

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 4.5 seconds | Under 2.5s | ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | 0.147 | Under 0.1 | ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT) | 0ms | Under 300ms | ✓ EXCELLENT |
| Speed Index | 3.2s | Under 3s | ✓ VERY GOOD |

### What This Means

**The Good News:**
- Perfect SEO technical foundation (100/100)
- Outstanding accessibility (97/100) - better than most competitors
- Instant interaction response (0ms blocking time)
- Good overall speed index (3.2s)
- Solid desktop performance (85/100)

**The Issues to Fix:**
- LCP at 4.5 seconds is above Google's 2.5s threshold
- CLS at 0.147 is above Google's 0.1 threshold
- Both impact rankings and user experience

**Why LCP Matters:**
When homeowners search for roofing services, they're often dealing with urgent problems (leaks, damage). A 4.5-second load time means some visitors will leave before seeing your services, costing you high-value roofing jobs.

**Why CLS Matters:**
Page elements jumping around can cause visitors to accidentally click the wrong button when trying to call for a quote. This is especially problematic on mobile where most roofing searches occur.

### Key Issues Impacting Performance

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Large Image Files | Adds 2+ seconds to LCP | CRITICAL |
| Unoptimized Hero Images | Major LCP contributor | CRITICAL |
| Missing Width/Height Attributes | Causes CLS issues | HIGH |
| Font Loading | Contributes to text shift | HIGH |
| Render-Blocking Resources | Delays initial paint | MEDIUM |

### Performance Targets (90 Days)

| Metric | Current | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Mobile Performance | 74 | 80-85 | 85-90 | 90+ |
| Desktop Performance | 85 | 90 | 92+ | 96+ |
| LCP | 4.5s | 3.5s | 3.0s | Under 2.5s |
| CLS | 0.147 | 0.12 | 0.10 | Under 0.1 |
| TBT | 0ms | 0ms | 0ms | 0ms (maintain) |
