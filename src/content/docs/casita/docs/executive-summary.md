# Executive Summary: Casita Azul SEO Strategy

## The Problem

Casita Azul's website has **zero keyword optimization**. Every page uses generic headings that don't help Google understand what the business offers or where it's located.

### Current vs. Optimized H1s

| Page | Current H1 | Optimized H1 |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Homepage | "Welcome to Casita Azul!" | "Spanish Immersion Preschool & Daycare in Portland, Oregon" |
| Our Story | "Discover Our Journey!" | "About Casita Azul: Portland's Latina-Owned Spanish Immersion School" |
| Programs | "Discover Our Programs!" | "Spanish Immersion Programs for Infants, Toddlers & Preschoolers" |
| Locations | "Welcome to Our Casitas!" | "Spanish Immersion Preschool & Daycare Locations in Portland Metro" |
| Admissions | "Getting Started" | "Enroll in Spanish Immersion Preschool & Daycare at Casita Azul" |
| Contact | "Contact Us!" | "Contact Casita Azul Spanish Immersion School" |
