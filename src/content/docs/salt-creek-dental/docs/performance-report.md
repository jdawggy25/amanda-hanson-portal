## Traffic

### Current Organic Traffic

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Monthly Organic Visitors | 671 | Baseline |
| Traffic Value | $77.51/month | Growing |
| Per-Visitor Value | $0.12 | Potential for improvement |

### Traffic Analysis

The current traffic volume shows strong keyword presence, but the relatively low traffic value indicates opportunity to better capture high-intent dental searches. The gap between keyword count (312) and traffic value suggests informational content is strong, but commercial/transactional keywords need more focus.

**Traffic Quality Assessment:**
- Strong informational content traffic (blog)
- Opportunity to increase commercial-intent traffic
- Local searches need strengthening
- Need to bridge gap between content and conversions

## Technical Performance

### Performance Scores (Google Lighthouse)

| Metric | Mobile | Desktop | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Performance | 53/100 | - | NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION |
| SEO | 100/100 | 100/100 | Excellent |
| Accessibility | 90/100 | 90/100 | Good |
| Best Practices | 79/100 | 79/100 | Good |

### Core Web Vitals

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | 8.5 seconds | Under 2.5s | ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | 0.205 | Under 0.1 | ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT) | 70ms | Under 300ms | ✓ GOOD |

### What This Means

**The Good News:**
- Perfect SEO technical foundation (100/100)
- Good accessibility for users with disabilities (90/100)
- Fast interaction response time once page loads (70ms TBT)
- Strong best practices foundation (79/100)

**The Critical Issues:**
- **LCP at 8.5 seconds is critical** - Google's threshold is 2.5 seconds
- **CLS at 0.205 is problematic** - Google's threshold is 0.1
- Both metrics negatively impact rankings and user experience

**Why LCP Matters:**
Slow loading pages frustrate visitors and hurt Google rankings. When potential patients wait 8+ seconds for your page to load, many will leave and choose a competitor instead. Studies show 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load.

**Why CLS Matters:**
Page elements shifting around while loading creates a poor user experience and can cause visitors to click the wrong buttons. This is especially frustrating on mobile devices where users are trying to tap phone numbers or book appointments.

**Real-World Impact:**
- Estimated 40-60% of mobile visitors leaving before page loads
- Lost patient appointments due to slow experience
- Lower Google rankings due to poor Core Web Vitals
- Competitive disadvantage against faster dental websites

### Key Issues Impacting Performance

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Large/Unoptimized Images | Major LCP contributor | CRITICAL |
| Render-Blocking Resources | Delays initial paint | CRITICAL |
| Missing Image Dimensions | Causes CLS issues | HIGH |
| Non-deferred JavaScript | Blocks rendering | HIGH |
| Server Response Time | Adds to overall load | MEDIUM |

### Performance Targets (90 Days)

| Metric | Current | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Mobile Performance | 53 | 65-70 | 80-85 | 90+ |
| LCP | 8.5s | Under 5s | Under 3.5s | Under 2.5s |
| CLS | 0.205 | 0.15 | 0.12 | Under 0.1 |
| TBT | 70ms | 60ms | 50ms | Under 50ms |
